# Exercise 2

Look at the ui in the browser and determine the data structure for your slack clone.
Make the data "reactive".

Checkout `App.vue` for more instructions!

Try the following things:
- Add or remove an item from the `window.chat.messages` array. Either through the browser console or the devtools
- Directly change an item in the `window.chat.messages` array (for example `window.chat.messages[0] = "test"`). What happens?
- Add a new property called `newProp` to `window.chat` through the browser console. What happens?
