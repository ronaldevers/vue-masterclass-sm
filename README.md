# Exercise 4

<<<<<<< HEAD
Change the code from the previous exercise to use v-model.
Allow the user to add a message.

## Possible approach

- step1: Change the message-field to listen to the input event of the text field. Write the text into the local state of the message-field component
- step2: Listen to the submit event of the form. 
- step3: dispatch the event to the chat-section
- step4: write the text into the message array (tip: use the createMessage method)
- step5: profit!
=======
Listen to the input event of the input field
and write the entered chat text into local state.
